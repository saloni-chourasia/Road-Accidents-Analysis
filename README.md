A road accident analysis dashboard provides data visualization and analysis of road accidents.

A road accident analysis dashboard can be a valuable tool for policymakers, law enforcement, and other stakeholders who are working to improve road safety and reduce the number of accidents. By providing timely and accurate data, a dashboard can help to inform decision-making and identify areas where intervention is needed to prevent accidents.
